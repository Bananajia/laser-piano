# laser-piano
look my description
It is just for our project which is inspired by the laser keyboards. Sounds so scientific! It should be used with camera and some special filter to your camera. Specifically, it looks like a virtual laser piano, which, in the software, needs control the hardware camera——needs a filter to give up all the lights except infrared ray——to get actually single input(of course the algorithm needs to do this work including elimination of noise) and control the computer amplifying sounds like piano when you play the "piano" in front of the camera. it is really a simple one that we can just use it in the computer, but it includes the corresponding coordinate( your hands play the real "piano", and the camera inputs a pair of coordinate to match our database with working out sounds), binarization and liminal value（it ebbs the noise to accelerate progress), graph analysis ( we need to get the signal and pick up the information which we need like the reflect light in your fingers and transform it as the coordinary) , etc. other details you can
ask me and we can discuss through email. I feel very welcome to chat with anybody! Come on!
